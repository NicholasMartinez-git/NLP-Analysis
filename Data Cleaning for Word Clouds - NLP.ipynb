       "\"Very loud, then we ordered what was on the menu, but when the food arrived some of it was not included in our order... When we asked the why question,  we were told that corporate had changed the menu but they didn't have time to update the menu just yet, so those items were not included in what we just ordered... What?!  We insisted that we should receive what we had ordered, and what was shown on the menu, so they relented and brought the items, but of course it was later, more than half way through our meal.  The wait person told us we were not the only table to complain.  Also, there is a 3% surcharge added to your bill on top of everything else, for issues pertaining to staffing, etc... What?!\\nSeems the restaurant is trying to make a point about the Byedan regime, but left a sour taste in our mouth.  The surcharge reference is clearly printed on the menu at the bottom, and they also make a point of stating it is NOT gratuity... Why wouldn't you just include the additional cost in the menu items?  Again, seems they want to make a very blatant statement about the state of things.  On the flip side, the food we received was good.  As with everything else, Piatti's was not 100% on their game, and we will wait a while before we recommend or go back.  When you're spending over one hundred dollars for 3 people on lunch, with one of them only eating an appetizer, and only 2 glasses of wine, you should expect near perfection... IMHO. Food was delicious. Service was wonderful. One of our favorite restaurants. I ordered a chicken panini and it was not good. The chicken was dry so I only ate less the half of it. There were flies buzzing all around us (and we were seated inside). We will not be coming back anytime soon. Outstanding service. Great atmosphere and terrific good. My Old Fashioned from the bar was excellent too. Celebrated My friend’s birthday and the two of us had a lovely dinner. Food and service were excellent as usual. Went for lunch. Increased prices and no lunch specials make it a less appealing option especially when the food itself is nothing spectacular. The fact they charge for bread now should have been a warning sign. Disappointed too that fresh ground pepper isn’t an option but a dirty pepper shaker is. Birthday dinner for our daughter. Great food; incredible service.  Love Piatti at the Quarry! Food and service was great! The restaurant building needs a little TLC. We asked to be moved because the wall next to the booths we were seated were attracting small little flies. After moving we also notice black mildew on the sealing around the air vents. Not sure if the wet atmosphere caused the flies but it just left a bad impression on us. Very good food. Nice portion size. A bit noisy but comfortable. Amazing food & service. The Chicken Alfredo and Seafood Lasagna were outstanding Mother’s Day Excellent Italian cuisine, superb service! Busy location and busy night, but we had a great experience I had a reservation and was quickly seated. Our server was very pleasant and accommodating. It was Friday lunch so the restaurant was busy. The food was delicious as always. Piatti is always a great experience. Disappointed in that it was my friends B-day and I had advised them both with you in making the reservation and at the door when I arrived.  \\n\\nNo acknowledgement whatsoever. Excellent menu, well prepared and presented food and friendly, efficient service! I have to say, I truly love this restaurant!  I was able to get same day reservations on a Saturday night.  When we got there it was very busy and they had the perfect booth reserved (with a reserved sign) for us.  Very impressed and the service and food were perfect!  While many restaurants are shrinking portion sizes and increasing prices, Piatti is on point and has not gone down that path.  Highly recommend!!! We had awesome service and the food was excellent. The music was a little loud, though. It was very hard to hear the person right across from me. Food was delicious and the service was good. Highly recommend for lunch. Great food & service! Good Food and Good Service. We celebrated Admin. Professionals Day and they made it special for our staff. Not going back till they get rid of the California service charge. \\nThis is Texas and they better get used to it Was too noisy! Couldn't enjoy each other's company. Service was very good. Food took a while to get to us. Was ready to leave right when the food got there. Drinks were pretty good. Derek was my server while also being the bartender. Service, engagement and interaction were amazing. Definitely recommend Piatti and Derek!!! Food and service were excellent! Happy we were able to scoot in for Easter! Food was not as good as in the past. The service lacked also from previous visits. Restaurant was very busy due to Easter and I believe the experience could have been much better It took our food almost an hour to get. The table that came after us got their food first. We only ordered pasta dishes. Very disappointing since it was our first date night in about 6 months! All red wine needs to be in bigger glasses. Had a very small glass for my wine. Food was spot on tonight! Family get together, the food is awesome as always, service was a bit of a disappointment this time around, never got the waiter’s name and didn’t ask for it either. The food and service was very good as usual! Piatti's is always a hit! I am never disappointed at Piatti!   The tilapia was excellent with just the right amount of seasoning. Sad. This has been a favorite restaurant of ours for many years. We used to always have great meals here. Unfortunately, tonight was a complete miss. Although only $3.00, they now charge for bread and dipping sauce.\\nMy husband order the chicken parmesan which he stated was good, but the piece of chicken must've been maybe 4 ozs.? Really small piece smothered with lots of pasta. I chose the grilled niman ranch organic 8oz flat iron steak. Flavorless, bland, no seared crispy outside. The sautéed spinach was very good, though, as well as the minimal pieces of Yukon potatoes. For dessert I ordered the lemon tart, which had a tasteless crust and decent lemon custard center.\\nI hope that maybe it was a bad day, and perhaps we just picked the wrong dishes. Service was good. Bread starter was excellent as were the apps and salads. Cocktails great. Main courses were not great , overcooked pasta, dry sauce, fish soaked in butter and oil with oily pasta that was not appetizing . Great location and great food, staff go's out of there way for excellent service, WE will be back A...unique take on Italian staples that to me were distracting, and overpowering, and ultimately disappointing. We couldn't eat the food, and I almost always finish my plate when I eat. A server rushed us out even though there were plenty of tables available. The food was good but not fabulous.  Service excellent (Ethan), and the noise level was moderate because we sat OUTSIDE.  Inside it's very loud.  Outdoor area is very pleasant. The staff was friendly and the food was excellent. Great experience. Excellent service and good food good people, we will be back I understand it was busy but he could have checked out more on us Very good place for pasta in the Quarry District of San Antonio.  Waiter was very friendly and offered his opinions.  The Ciabatta bread was excellent with a nice olive oil, balsamic and garlic mix.  Wedge and Caesar salads were very good but a little too much dressing g for our liking.   We all had pasta of some sort and it was all really good.   Not 5 stars but a solid 4 and we had a good time. We love coming to Piatti’s on Basse.  Kaylee always greets us and knows our favorite place to sit.  Andrew is such a top rated waiter.  He knows exactly what we want and need.\""

organic  flat iron steak flavorless bland no seared crispy outside the sautéed spinach was very good though as well as the minimal pieces of yukon potatoes for dessert i ordered the lemon tart which had a tasteless crust and decent lemon custard centeri hope that maybe it was a bad day and perhaps we just picked the wrong dishes service was good bread starter was excellent as were the apps and salads cocktails great main courses were not great  overcooked pasta dry sauce fish soaked in butter and oil with oily pasta that was not appetizing  great location and great food staff gos out of there way for excellent service we will be back aunique take on italian staples that to me were distracting and overpowering and ultimately disappointing we couldnt eat the food and i almost always finish my plate when i eat a server rushed us out even though there were plenty of tables available the food was good but not fabulous  service excellent ethan and the noise level was moderate because we sat outside  inside its very loud  outdoor area is very pleasant the staff was friendly and the food was excellent great experience excellent service and good food good people we will be back i understand it was busy but he could have checked out more on us very good place for pasta in the quarry district of san antonio  waiter was very friendly and offered his opinions  the ciabatta bread was excellent with a nice olive oil balsamic and garlic mix  wedge and caesar salads were very good but a little too much dressing g for our liking   we all had pasta of some sort and it was all really good   not  stars but a solid  and we had a good time we love coming to piattis on basse  kaylee always greets us and knows our favorite place to sit  andrew is such a top rated waiter  he knows exactly what we want and need'"
